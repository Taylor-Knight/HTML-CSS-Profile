        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I currently work for Lancashire County Countil (LCC) in ICT. I have worked here for nearly 2 years now (1 year and 8
            months)
            I grew up in watersports, wakeboarding, Surfong, paddle boarding nd all things related to water.
            Other than the watersports, I have also spent alot of time with my tech, be this build my own PC's, gaming or
            through my career paths.
            I love being Outdoors as part the watersports but also going on walks when I can and genrally just being
            outside.
            Music is also a huge part of my life. I tend to listen to rock/ metal music but this also expandis to most
            genres.

        <h3>Challanges faced</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Through my ICT role at LCC I have been tasked with training and coaching many fellow colleagues.
                A challenge I faced only a couple of months ago, I was with a junior colleage with them shadowing me as I took telephony calls.
                The colleague started to become frustrated as they had spent many day doing the similar activity.
                I changed the dynamic of the session and let them take the calls.
                Still being there if the needed advise, through using leading and open questions, guided this colleague to succesfully completing
                a shift of their own.
                This difused the sitution where the colleague was frustrated and gave them valuable experience on the job role.
