            <h3>About me</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>I currently work for Lancashire County Countil (LCC) in ICT. I have worked here for nearly 2 years now (1
                year and 8
                months)
                I grew up in watersports, Wakeboarding, Surfing, Paddleboarding and all things related to water.
                Other than the watersports, I have also spent alot of time with my tech, be this build my own PC's, gaming
                or
                through my career paths.
                I love being Outdoors as part the watersports but also going on walks when I can and genrally just being
                outside.
                Music is also a huge part of my life. I tend to listen to rock/ metal music but this also expandis to most
                genres.

                <h3>Challanges faced</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <ol>
                    <li>Through my ICT role at LCC I have been tasked with training and coaching many fellow colleagues.
                        A challenge I faced only a couple of months ago, I was with a junior colleage with them shadowing me as
                        I took telephony calls.
                        The colleague started to become frustrated as they had spent many day doing the similar activity.
                        I changed the dynamic of the session and let them take the calls.
                        Still being there if the needed advise, through using mentoring skills like leading and open questions,
                        guided this colleague to succesfully completing
                        a shift of their own.
                        This diffused the situation where the colleague was frustrated and gave them valuable experience on the
                        job role.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another challenge I have faced is this, CODE Lancashire, it's already made me change how I view and
                        analyse things and look more in depth into how.
                        It challenges me to learn new things, at the time of writing I am tryimg to learn how to link a piece of
                        java script code that I have written as a
                        side project before starting Code Lancashire. I am stuck at the point where I believe it all being
                        linked but nothing is linked when inspexting the page.
                        My resolution to this (30 minutes later) was using stack overflow and google to help understand this
                        process more.
                        Now the Javascript rock paper scissors game plays in the console of the site.
                    </li>
                    <li>I am a learner drive at the moment and first took my Theory test at the beginning of August. I failed
                        this by 1 mark on the multiple choice questions and I was gutted.
                        How ever I didnt let this get me down, I revised and studdied at every available opportunity and when I
                        tool the test again on the 23rd I passed!
                        This wouldn't have been possible if I hadn't devoted myself to studying and learning.

        <h3>Education/Professional experiences</h3>
        <p>My education consisted of school (Lostock Hall Academy) and colleage (Runshaw).
            In school I subject such as art, P.E., Music and geography.
            At Runchaw I studies BTec Applied Science
            My education ends here as I chose not to go to University and pursure any further education.
        <ul>
            <li>I started my work life along side school when I was 14 as I became a wakeboard instructor as watersports
                was a huge part of my upbring.
                This gave me valueable skills in dealing and handling people which I would use later in my work life.
            </li>
            <li>After this, from the age of 18, I worked in various pubs around the Preston and penwortham area for
                ajust over 2 years.
                This also developed my people skills thurther and taught me how to be calming to others when a high
                intesity situation broke out.
                Another skill that was further devolped in this time was dealing with and handling, this became more
                important as they were now drunk people which react to situations differently.
                So this taught me how to amend and adapt what I was and trying to get across where no further issues
                would be caused.
            </li>
            <li>My first job in tech was in sales at Carphone Warehouse, this was on a shop floor interacting with
                customers and advising and selling phone contracts and broadband.
                Once again this developed my customer service skills, in particular this taught me how to read people's
                body language which gave me a feel for how I should act in any particular sale.
                The interest in tech from my up bringing was a huge impact in going for this role as the hardware of the
                mobile devices and software they useed facinated me.
                My reason for leaving this is the culture around sales and being pushed by my higher ups to make a sale
                when I didn't believe it was within the customers best interests.
            </li>
            <li>My most current role is working for LCC in tech support. This is where I have been for the last 2 years
                (almost) and I work in a team specific to the software we use in the council, installing it and
                upporting any issues that arise.
                Dealing with customers is the majority of the role and helping with their issues via telepohny calls and
                written incidents,
                the vast majority of customers I deal with are Lancashire's social workers and assisting them with their
                social care systems.
                Ontop of this I work many shifts supporting directly with the County councillors in individual matters
                and issues in the council chambers when meetings are taking place.
                My desire to learn code and be on this project stems, in 1 area, from me wanting to deviate for a
                customer facing role which has been the majority of my working life.
                I also love the learning it entails and from what I hvae done sofar in CODE Lancashire and in my own
                personal time, really enjoy the development process and making sure everything I write works correctly
                as an end result.

    <div id="Skills" >
        <h3>My Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer service. All jobs I have had have been relating too or heavily involved with a customer facing front. 
                From this being the case I have developed excellent customer service skills across all areas from frustration, anger, not technically confident and distressed.
            </li>
            <li>Technically minded. From my current and previous job roles and personal intrests in tech I am very technically minded, be this about how software is deployed in a corporate environment
                or the specifications or a specific gadget, computer, mobile device, ect.
            </li>
            <li>Through my upbringing I am very skilled when it comes to watersports of quite a few different varieties. as previously mention these imclude but not limited too Wakeboarding, Surfing, Paddleboarding.
            </li>
            <li>I am very much at the beginning of my coding journey just I have done bits with Javascript previously and now html.
                Granted, like I have said, this is the beginnging but I would say I am capable of studying and learning at a fast pase and I cannot eait to see where this course will take me.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div id="projects" >
        <h3>My Projecs</h3>
        <p> In regards to projects and side pieces of work I have done, there isn't a huge ammount of coding specific work I have done other than this html site and I made a game f rock paper scissors in javascript.
            With this site it has taught me how to look into and what to look for when I have ran into a specific problem.
            I have used stack overflow in creating this site, when I ran into issues with inserting my js code into the body of this code which gave me a great understanding of using the style tag and type attribute.
        </p>
        <p> Other than thisone of the main coding projects I have done is creating the rock paper scissor game in js. it works by inspecting the page and looking at the console.
            Every time the page is reloaded it generates a different result every time. I have set the person choice to 'rock' and using multiple different fuctions, math random and math floor to generate a random number that is assigned to a result.
            As an addition to the standard game I added in the choice of 'bomb' which over rules all computer choices and the play will always win.
